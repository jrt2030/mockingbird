----

Mockingbird is an open source distributed and programmable fault simulation mocking service.

It provides an extensible set of middleware layers that enable the simulation of
variety of different service faults under load testing. The framework serves two primary purposes:

1. Allow consumers to test the way they handle services that exhibit uncertainty and
instability, under load.
2. Test the behaviour of proxy, load-balancing and API gateway layers (the infrastructure
that sits between the API providers and API consumers)

Mockingbird is built so that it can be used as an [NPM] package. It can also be
used as a stand-alone `cli` as well as part of a [Serverless] ecosystem by deploying
it using `serverless framework`.

The current version supports adding new simulation layers. Future version will allow for
extension of existing layers through extnesion of `classes` and `interfaces`.

Mockingbird is completely stateless, making it highly scalable. You can run it in one container
or a thousand ðŸ¤“ Being *programmable* means that with every request, you simply supply the kinds of simulations you'd
like to run against the request and the probability of failure occurence (`0.0 - 1.0`)

----
## How does it work

It's simple - you blast your Mockingbird service endpoint (i.e. `localhost:3333/api/v1/mock`) with a tonne of `POST` requests,
specifying a `body` payload and a `settings` payload.

```
curl -d "@data.json" -X POST http://localhost:3333/api/v1/mock
```

... `data.json` being:
```
{
	"body": ..., 
	"settings": ...
}
```

The `body` payload represents your normal HTTP resource representation data, while `settings` represents the simulation
settings you'd like to simulate with some level of uncertainty. For example, as part of the settings, you may specify
the probability of the fault occurence.

```{
	"body": ..., 
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"connection": "connection_reset_by_peer"
	}
}
```

The above example tells the Mockingbird service to cause a `connection_reset_by_peer` (and abrupt closure of the socket),
20% of the time



## Mockingbird is awesome
> This project is powered by github ðŸŒŸs ^ go ahead and [star it please](https://github.com/sasasavic82/mockingbird/stargazers).

> With great languages comes great responsibility!!!

### Why
There is a need for an open source fault simulation framework ... why not?

### Requirements

* NodeJS v10

## Get it up and running quickly

Get it (global installation):
```
npm install @imbueapp/mockingbird -g
```

Run it
```
mockingbird
```

Mockingbird runs on default port `3333`, but you can set a environmental variable `MOCKINGBIRD_SERVICE_PORT` to your desired port and then run `mockingbird` command.

```
export MOCKINGBIRD_SERVICE_PORT=5555
```

## Mockingbird simulation layers
Mockingbird comes with a number of simulation middleware layers. As HTTP requests are
traversed through the different layers, a probability of fault occurence is calculated.

You have the option to control the probability of failure, from `0.0` (no failure) to
`1.0` (absolute failure).

Below are the layers currently supported by the framework.

### Body fault simulation
A variety of simulations that attempt to permutate the original body, such that the response payload is different to the original.

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"body": {
			"randomContentType": true,
			"randomRemove": true
		}
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

#### Random content type
This layer introduces uncertainty by setting a random content type. As an example, an `application/json`
content type may be switched to `text/xml` or any number of other mime types.

Sometimes, services tend to respond with an arbitrary mime type. Generally this behaviour is exhibited in
legacy systems, where you may see `ebXML` or `SOAP`-like messages.

#### Random property remove
Randomly remove a property from an object or remove an item from an array. 

### Header fault simulation
HTTP headers let the client and the server pass additional information with an HTTP request or response. They
are an integral part of client-server communication and often convey important information about the client or
about the server.

They are also used as important routing mechanisms, particularly if services rely on the additional data that
you would not traditionally convey in the HTTP body.

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"headers": {
			"injectRandom": true,
			"permutate": true,
			"extraHeaders": [{
				"key": "sash_key",
				"value": "sash_value"
			}]
        }
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

#### Inject extra headers
Given *Mockingbird* has a programmable interface, you may specify additional headers as part of your request. If
this layer is executed (based on the fault probability), those additional headers will be injeted as part of
service's response.

You may use this to check the behaviour of proxy, load-balancing and API gateway layers and see if they tend to
strip off certain headers.

#### Inject random headers
Inject random and arbitrary headers in the response.

#### Permutate headers
Swap key/values of headers around, or change the value of an existing header.

### Delay fault simulation
Delay simulation layer is an extremely useful layer that allows you simulate various network and service computation
latencies.

#### Fixed delay
If the fixed delay simulation layer is executed, the response will be delayed by a fixed amount of time, supplied as
part of the simulation configuration.

Example below, delaying for `1000ms` (1 second)

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"delay": {
			"type": "fixed",
			"delay": 1000
		}
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

#### Uniform delay
**TBA**
A uniform distribution can be used for simulating a stable latency with a fixed amount of jitter. You define it via:

lower - Lower bound of the range, inclusive.
upper - Upper bound of the range, inclusive.

For instance, to simulate a stable latency of 20ms +/- 5ms, use lower = 15 and upper = 25.

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"delay": {
			"type": "uniform",
			"lower": 15,
            "upper": 25
		}
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

#### Lognormal delay
**TBA**
In addition to fixed delays, a delay can be sampled from a random distribution. This allows simulation of more specific downstream latencies, such as a long tail.

A lognormal distribution is a pretty good approximation of long tailed latencies centered on the 50th percentile. It takes two parameters:

median - The 50th percentile of latencies.
sigma - Standard deviation. The larger the value, the longer the tail.

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"delay": {
			"type": "lognormal",
			"median": 95,
            "sigma": 0.1
		}
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

#### Chunk dribble delay
**TBA**

Dribble your responses back in chunks. This is very useful when simulating slow networks and deterministic timeouts.

It takes two parameters:

numberOfChunks - how many chunks you want your response body divided up into
totalDuration - the total duration you want the response to take in milliseconds

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
		"delay": {
			"type": "lognormal",
			"numberOfChunks": 50,
            "totalDuration": 3000
		}
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

### Connection fault simulation
Sometimes you may want to simulate various connection faults

#### Connection reset by peer
Abruptly end an existing connection, not returning a status or a payload.

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
        "connection": "connection_reset_by_peer"
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```

#### Empty response
Abruptly end the connection with a 200 OK HTTP response, but don't provide a body.

```
{
	"settings": {
		"failureProbability": 0.2,
        "connection": "empty_response"
	},
	"body": {
		"name": "Sasa",
		"surname": "Savic",
		"handle": "sasasavic82"
	}
}
```
